	abstract = {Growing evidence from the emerging and developed world indicates a link between environmental conditions and mental wellbeing, however, little is known about the relationship between this relationship in the developing world where environmental conditions are often much harsher and the demands on mental health can be substantial. In this paper we investigate the link between exposure to high temperatures and particulate matter and self-reported mental health in India data from a massive, nationwide survey linked to conditions at each respondent's residence in the time leading up to their enumeration. While, we find that exposure to higher temperatures and concentrations of particulate matter in the lead up to enumeration is predictive of poorer self-reported mental well-being, we also identify an adaptive spillover effect whereby harms from {PM} exposure are lower-magnitude on hot days.},
