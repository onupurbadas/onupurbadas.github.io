<section>
  <p>Iâ€™m an <strong>applied micro-economist</strong> at UMass Amherst working at the intersection of <em>environment, development,</em> and <em>social inequities</em>. My research focuses on how <strong>political representation</strong> for historically marginalized communities impacts <strong>development</strong> outcomes, using measures like night time lights intensity and <strong>environmental</strong> outcomes like forest cover using VCF data.
  </p>

  <p>Current projects include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How women's political leadership in local government affects forest conservation</li>
    <li>The role of caste-based leadership in driving development and forest outcomes</li>
  </ul>

  <p> Another completed project investigates the <strong>link between environmental conditions and mental wellbeing</strong>, focusing on high temperatures and exposure to particulate matter and it's impacts on self-reported mental health outcomes in India</p>
