I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Resource Economics at UMass Amherst. My research interests lie at the intersection of environment, development and merginalized identities. My dissertation explores the intersection of environmental conservation, social inequality and power relations through three main chapters. Conducted in a developing country context, my research focuses on: i) how representation of historically marginalized groups in local institutions impacts the environment, ii) the conditions required to translate policies -- aimed at addressing unequal access to power - into on-ground changes and iii) how climate change driven rising temperatures may impact the mental well-being of vulnerable people. To this, in Chapter 1, I examine whether the presence of women in political leadership impacts the management of environmental resources, specifically local forest cover. In Chapter 2, I explore a similar question, focusing on the representation of oppressed castes. I also look at how the caste and gender positionalities interact and influence the local environmental public good. Chapter 3 focuses on the question of how climate change driven increasing temperatures impact mental health, particularly in aging populations.
