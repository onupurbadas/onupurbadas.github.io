My research interests span environment, development, and policy, with a focus on the intersections of environmental conservation, social inequality, and power dynamics.

To these ends, my current work explores:
    a. How the representation of historically marginalized groups in local institutions impact the environment.
    b. The conditions necessary for translating policies aimed at addressing unequal power access into tangible outcomes.
    c. The effects of climate change, particularly rising temperatures, on the mental well-being of vulnerable populations.

I am currently engaged in three projects:
    - Investigating the impact of women in political leadership on local forest management.
    - Examining the influence of oppressed castes in leadership positions on local environmental and development outcomes. 
    - Analyzing how climate change-driven temperature increases affect mental health, particularly among aging populations.
