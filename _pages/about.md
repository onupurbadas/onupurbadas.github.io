<p> Iâ€™m an applied economist working at the intersection of environment, development and social inequities. </p>

Two of my current projects explore how political representation for historically marginalized communities impacts development and the environment, particularly through the lenses of caste and gender in rural India.
    
The impact of political leadership of women in government 
on local forest cover.

The impact of oppressed castes in leadership positions 
on local development as proxied by nightlight and 
forest cover outcomes. 

My other project is looking at the link between environmental conditions and mental wellbeing - particularly exploring how exposure to high temperatures and particulate matter links to self-reported mental healthin India.
