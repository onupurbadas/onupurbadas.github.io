  title = {Political Representation, Forest Cover, and Development in Rural India},
  abstract={This paper investigates the impact of caste-based political reservations in leadership of local governance on economic and environmental outcomes, focusing on Karnataka, India. A 1992 legislation introduced electoral quotas(reservations) in village councils to ensure political representation for marginalized groups, specifically Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST). Leveraging quasi-random variation in seat allocation for the council chairperson position across multiple election terms, we analyze a comprehensive dataset of over 5,000 councils for 5 elections between 1994-2010 to assess how SC and ST leadership affects two critical metrics: forest cover, as a measure of environmental stewardship, and night-time lights, as a proxy for economic activity. Our difference-in-differences approach indicates that SC-ST leadership is associated with increased local development but also reveals reductions in forest cover, with divergent effects between SC and ST leaders. These findings suggest a complex interaction between representation, development, and environmental sustainability, highlighting the need for policies that empower marginalized leaders with resources to balance development goals and conservation efforts.},

  title = {Women Leadership and Deforestation in Rural India},
  abstract={This paper examines the impact of womenâ€™s leadership in village councils on forest conservation in rural India. Using randomized reservations for women chairs and vice-chairs in Karnataka's village councils from 1992 to 2010, spanning five election terms, we analyze changes in forest cover using satellite data. While single-term reservations for women in leadership show no significant effect, two key factors enhance their impact on forest conservation: consecutive terms of women serving as chair and the simultaneous reservation of both chair and vice-chair roles for women. Forest cover shows the greatest improvement when both positions are held by women over multiple election terms, emphasizing the importance of sustained leadership and multiple positions of power for women. However, instances where both positions are reserved for women over consecutive terms occur less frequently than expected under randomization. This raises questions about structural and societal barriers that may limit the transfer of real power and the full potential of these policies, highlighting the need for further investigation into how such barriers can be addressed.},

	title = {Temperature, Particulate Matter, and Mental Health in India},
	abstract = {Growing evidence from the emerging and developed world indicates a link between environmental conditions and mental wellbeing, however, little is known about the relationship between this relationship in the developing world where environmental conditions are often much harsher and the demands on mental health can be substantial. In this paper we investigate the link between exposure to high temperatures and particulate matter and self-reported mental health in India data from a massive, nationwide survey linked to conditions at each respondent's residence in the time leading up to their enumeration. While, we find that exposure to higher temperatures and concentrations of particulate matter in the lead up to enumeration is predictive of poorer self-reported mental well-being, we also identify an adaptive spillover effect whereby harms from {PM} exposure are lower-magnitude on hot days.},
